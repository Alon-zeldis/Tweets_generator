# Tweets_generator
This program reads a text file and finds all the unique words in it, meaning if the word "dog" is used 3 times in the file, the program considers the first apperance of the word as unique and the other times as repetitions. The program builds a dictionary with the unique words as key and a list of all the words that comes after the repetitions as value. The program then builds sentences using a random choice of a key and then continues with choosing a word each time from the following list of words in the value of each unique word.

!!!make sure the justdoit_tweets.txt is in the same directory as the project functions for the default path option to work!!!
